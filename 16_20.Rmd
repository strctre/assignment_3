## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
pseudo_mercator <- "+proj=merc +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"

weibo <- weibo %>%
  st_transform(pseudo_mercator)

school <- school %>%
  st_transform(pseudo_mercator)

greenspace <- greenspace %>%
  st_transform(pseudo_mercator)

township <- township %>%
  st_transform(pseudo_mercator)
```

```{r}
ggplot(township)+
  geom_sf(fill = "grey", color = "white")+
  geom_sf(data = weibo, color = "red", size = 0.01)+
  theme_map()+
  annotation_scale()
```
```{r}
township <- township %>%
  mutate(num_weibo = lengths(st_covers(township, weibo)))
```
